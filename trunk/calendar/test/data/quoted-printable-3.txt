Hello Friend=2C

With due respect and humbleness=2C I am writing you this letter to
request with my sincere heart for your assistance and hoped that my
request shall meet you in good condition=2E

My name is Arusi Ikwunnam Mike=2C i am 21 year's old=2C my father died of
AIDS Virus last 3 months ago =28 may his gentle soul rest in peace =29
during his time in hospital=2C he briefed me in close confidence of his
Money=2C which is about=3A US$ 14=2Emillion that he left in a foreign
country for safe keeping as the resort of insecurity in our country
due to the civil war=2C this Money as he told me was made for the
purchase of industrial plant's before he failed ill unfortunately and
was dead=2E

In the process of securing this Money=2C i left my country and has now
arrived here in Senegal as my father advised me before his untimely
death to move this Money to any foreign country of my choice where it
will be properly invested as it is not safe investing in our country
due to the civil war=2E

It is based on this advise that i am contacting you as i am just a
student and does not have any knowledge of investmenting this whole
Money=2E

Yours Sincerely=2C
Arusi Ikwunnam Mike=2E
